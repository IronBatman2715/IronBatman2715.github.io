  <p>
    My Google drive is full of almost all of the official D&D books in PDF form and character sheet templates (many with
    auto-math macros).
    <br /><br />
    This is also where I host all my campaigns. So look here for session 0 information, art (maps, drawings, pictures, etc.),
    your party members' character sheets, and the spreadsheet where I keep every character's current status (conditions &
    HP)!

    A web app that allows you to view all official Races(and their Subraces) as well as Backgrounds. You can then toggle
    each source book so you can only view from a subset of the total.
