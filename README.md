## Cloning/Forking Notes

Automatic deployment **requires** the repository be set up according to the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow)!

If you wish to clone/fork this repository, note that you will need [Git-LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) installed to properly fetch some assets.

## References

Original versions of optimized assets as well as currently unused assets are stored in [`assetArchive`](./assetArchive/).

The only asset I created myself is the favicon. I do not own any of the other assets. I have simply converted them to web optimized formats (webp, ico, svg).
